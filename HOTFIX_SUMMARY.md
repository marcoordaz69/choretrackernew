# Hotfix Summary - Voice Assistant Memory System

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Severity:** Critical - Production crash on voice calls
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and deployed

---

## Issue 1: Memory System Not Connected

### Problem
Voice assistant (Luna) had amnesia - knew nothing about users between calls.

### Root Cause
**File:** `server/assistant/services/voiceService.js:93`

Hardcoded instructions instead of loading dynamic user context:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
instructions: `[40+ lines of static text with no user data]`
```

### Fix
**Commit:** `f68264e`

Changed to load user context dynamically:
```javascript
// AFTER (CORRECT):
instructions: await this.getVoiceInstructions(user)
```

Added loading of active tasks, goals, and habits:
```javascript
const activeGoals = await aiService.getActiveGoalsContext(user.id);
const activeTasks = await aiService.getActiveTasksContext(user.id);
const activeHabits = await aiService.getActiveHabitsContext(user.id);
```

### Impact
✅ Luna now knows:
- User's name
- Active tasks with due dates
- Active goals with progress
- Active habits with streaks
- User interests, challenges, values
- Recent wins
- Communication preferences

## Issue 2: Database Model Mismatch (CRITICAL CRASH)

### Problem
Production crash with `TypeError: Goal.find is not a function`

Voice calls immediately failed when trying to load user context.

### Root Cause
**File:** `server/assistant/services/aiService.js:123, 142, 167`

Code tried to use **Mongoose** methods on **Supabase** models:
```javascript
// WRONG - Mongoose syntax:
const goals = await Goal.find({ userId, status: 'active' }).limit(5).lean();
const tasks = await Task.find({ userId, status: { $in: ['pending'] } })...
const habits = await Habit.find({ userId, active: true }).limit(5).lean();
```

Models are actually using **Supabase PostgreSQL** with different methods:
- `Goal.findActive(userId)`
- `Task.findPending(userId)`
- `Habit.findByUserId(userId, true)`

### Fix
**Commit:** `081c1b1`

Updated all three context methods:

**Goals:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const goals = await Goal.find({ userId, status: 'active' }).limit(5).lean();

// AFTER:
const goals = await Goal.findActive(userId);
```

**Tasks:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const tasks = await Task.find({ userId, status: { $in: ['pending'] } })...

// AFTER:
const tasks = await Task.findPending(userId);
```

**Habits:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const habits = await Habit.find({ userId, active: true }).limit(5).lean();

// AFTER:
const habits = await Habit.findByUserId(userId, true); // true = activeOnly
```

Also fixed field name mismatches:
- `dueDate` → `due_date`
- `streak.current` → `current_streak`
- `streak.longest` → `longest_streak`

### Impact
✅ Voice calls no longer crash
✅ User context loads successfully
✅ Tasks, goals, and habits display correctly

## Deployment Timeline

**f68264e** - Memory system enabled (19:26 UTC)
**081c1b1** - Database model fix (19:35 UTC)

**Railway auto-deploy:** ~2-3 minutes after push

## Testing Checklist

After production restart, verify:

- [ ] Call connects without crashing
- [ ] Luna greets user by name (if onboarded)
- [ ] "What's my schedule?" returns actual tasks
- [ ] Task creation works: "Remind me to X"
- [ ] Goal tracking works: "I want to Y"
- [ ] Habit logging works: "I did Z today"
- [ ] Second call shows continuity from first call
- [ ] No `Goal.find is not a function` errors in logs

---

## What to Test Now

### 1. First Call (Onboarding)
Call your Twilio number.

**Luna should say:**
> "Hey there! I'm your new personal assistant, calling to introduce myself and learn a bit about you. First off, what should I call you?"

**You:** Tell her your name and what you need help with.

**Luna:** Should ask about your challenges, values, motivations.

**Behind the scenes:** Calls `update_user_profile` to save everything.

### 2. Create Some Data
**Create a task:**
> "Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 2pm"

**Create a goal:**
> "I want to lose 10 pounds by June"

**Log a habit:**
> "I went to the gym today"

### 3. Call Again (Memory Test)
Hang up and call back.

**Luna should:**
- Greet you by name: "Hey Marco!"
- Know your tasks: "You have 'call mom' tomorrow at 2pm"
- Know your goals: "You're working on losing 10 pounds"
- Know your habits: "You hit the gym today - nice work!"

### 4. What's My Schedule?
**You:** "What do I have coming up?"

**Luna should list:**
- Your pending tasks with due dates
- Your active goals with progress
- Your habit streaks

## Server Logs to Monitor

**Success looks like:**
```
Voice stream started for Marco (CA...)
[SESSION CONFIG] Using gpt-realtime-mini-2025-10-06 with Luna persona
OpenAI Realtime API connected
Session created: sess_xxxxx
User said: [your message]
[FUNCTION CALL] Executing: create_task {...}
AI said: [Luna's response]
```

**Errors to watch for:**
- ❌ `Goal.find is not a function` (should be fixed now)
- ❌ `OpenAI WebSocket not open, state: 0` (normal for first few packets)
- ❌ Any crashes during `getVoiceInstructions` call

## If Issues Persist

### Check Railway Deployment
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway logs --tail 100

# Or check Railway dashboard
# https://railway.app/project/[your-project]/deployments
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Revert to before memory fix
git revert 081c1b1 f68264e
git push

# Or checkout specific commit
git checkout 4b8b5ee  # Before memory changes
git push --force  # DANGER - only if necessary
```

### Check Database Connection
Verify Supabase is accessible:
```bash
# In Railway dashboard or logs, check:
✓ Supabase connection: Successfully connected to Supabase PostgreSQL
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

1. **Memory System:** Code was written but never activated
   - `getVoiceInstructions()` method existed (lines 443-556)
   - Loaded user context from database
   - Built personalized instructions
   - **But was never called** - hardcoded text used instead

2. **Model Mismatch:** Codebase migration incomplete
   - Models were migrated from MongoDB (Mongoose) to Supabase (PostgreSQL)
   - Voice service was updated to use Supabase models
   - **But aiService.js still used Mongoose syntax**
   - No type checking or tests caught the mismatch

### Prevention

**For future:**
- [ ] Add integration tests for voice calls
- [ ] Type checking for model methods (TypeScript?)
- [ ] Staging environment for testing before production
- [ ] Automated tests for database queries

## Success Criteria

Memory system is working when:

1. ✅ Luna uses your name consistently
2. ✅ Luna references your actual tasks when asked
3. ✅ Luna knows your goals and progress
4. ✅ Luna tracks your habit streaks
5. ✅ Luna remembers interests/challenges/values you share
6. ✅ Calling back shows continuity from previous calls
7. ✅ New information is saved via `update_user_profile`
8. ✅ No crashes or errors in production logs

**Status:** Ready for testing
**Next:** Call your Twilio number and verify memory is working!
