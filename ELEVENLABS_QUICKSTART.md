## Troubleshooting

### "Call fails or disconnects"
- Check Twilio credentials are correct
- Verify phone number format: +1234567890

### "I don't hear anything"
- Check your phone volume
- Try calling again (sometimes first call has issues)

### "Voice is robotic/bad"
- Make sure you picked an ElevenLabs voice (not default)
- Try a different voice from the library

### "Connection error"
- Wait 30 seconds and try again
- Check ElevenLabs dashboard for error logs

## Next: Add Your User Context (Optional)

Once it's working, you can make it personal:

### Add Dynamic Variables to the Prompt:

Replace the simple prompt with this:

```
You are {{user_name}}'s personal assistant. Be warm, conversational, and helpful.

Current date: {{current_date}}
User's timezone: {{user_timezone}}

Keep responses concise since this is a phone call. Listen carefully and respond naturally.
```

Then when setting up the integration, you can pass user-specific data.

But for now - **just enjoy talking to it!** ðŸŽ‰
